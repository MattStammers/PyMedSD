# PyMedSD

#### Open Source System Dynamics Modelling By Matt Stammers and Project RUM

Here is a simple demo SD model which was initially developed in Stella architect:

It was then compiled into python code. It is pretty simple and acts as a basic demo model for training new SD python programmers.

This is a very early project so watch this space as we work to make SD in python cool for a new generation

We will now aim to recreate this using the ASDM framework developed by Wang Zhao https://github.com/wzh1895/ASDM
